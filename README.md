# About Me

I’m an IT and security-focused technologist with a strong interest in how systems fail, why insecure practices persist, and how attackers take advantage of both. My background includes Windows environments, Active Directory, scripting, and network troubleshooting, along with high-responsibility operational roles in the U.S. Navy and hands-on IT work across small to enterprise environments.

I’m interested in the gap between how systems are supposed to be secured and how they actually fail in the real world.

I tend to learn by building, breaking, and then documenting what went wrong. This GitHub is a place for security-focused automation, lab-based attack simulations, defensive lessons learned from offensive techniques, and anything else I find interesting enough to dig into deeply.

Long-term, I’m aiming toward red-team work. Short-term, I care about becoming the kind of security practitioner who understands systems well enough to explain why something is risky—not just that it is.

## Areas I Like to Work In

Windows security & Active Directory (from both admin and attacker perspectives)

Incident response, log analysis, and “what would this look like if it were abused?”

Automation with PowerShell and Python

Network security, segmentation, and misconfiguration analysis

OT / ICS security fundamentals

## Notes

Everything here is built in lab environments or from public data. No proprietary systems, no production abuse—just controlled experimentation and documentation.
