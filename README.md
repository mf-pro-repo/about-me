# about-me
I'm an IT and security-focused professional with experience in Windows systems, Active Directory, scripting, and network troubleshooting. My background includes high-responsibility operational roles in the U.S. Navy and hands-on IT support and management across small to enterprise environments.

I'm building this GitHub to document practical security projects, automation tools, and learning exercises as I continue developing toward red-team and SOC-focused roles.
As well as a way to document any other fun tidbits I find along the way.
